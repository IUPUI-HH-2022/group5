      New Zealand’s education system is governed by one body: the New Zealand Ministry of Education. They are able to provide guidance and recommendations to all schools from pre-school to grade 13.

    <h1>Race and Ethnicity</h1>
    <div class="group">
    <p style="width: 400px">New Zealand has four major racial/ethnic groups: Pākehā (European), Māori, Asian, and Pacific Islander. Because it is so diverse, it is important for the New Zealand education system to be sensitive to the needs of students from different backgrounds. For people new to New Zealand, they created the “Migrant Settlement and Integration Strategy” to help support new migrants in five key areas, including education. New Zealand also has a Human Rights Bill, which prohibits discrimination based on race or ethnicity. Specific to the Māori population, New Zealand also offers Māori-medium education, with some subjects taught in the Māori language.

  <h1>Gender</h1>
  <p>The New Zealand Ministry for Education publishes Te Whāriki, which is a curriculum for all school-age children. It is divided into two main frameworks, an indigenous framework, and a bicultural framework. From their website:  
    <br><br>Te Whāriki is an inclusive curriculum – a curriculum for all children. Inclusion encompasses gender and ethnicity, diversity of ability and learning needs, family structure and values, socio-economic status, and religion.  
<br><br>
Te Whāriki holds the promise that all children will be empowered to learn with and alongside others by engaging in experiences that have meaning for them. This requires Kaiako to actively respond to the strengths, interests, abilities and needs of each child and, at times, provide them with additional support in relation to learning, behavior, development, or communication.  
  </p>

<h1>LGBTQ</h1>
<div class="group">
<p style="width: 450px"><a href=" https://inclusive.tki.org.nz/guides/"target="_blank">This website</a> created by the New Zealand Ministry of Education and designed for educators, goes into great detail on how schools can meet the needs of students with a wide array of different needs and challenges. In their guide for LGBTIQA+ students, the Ministry of Education first outlines the key concerns of students who are part of this community. Gender neutral toilet facilities, use of preferred name and pronouns, and protection from bullying and harassment were three of the main concerns identified. The Ministry of Education includes articles and videos for educators, not only identifying the concerns but also outlining six specific strategies on how educators can try and meet the needs of students.   
<br><br>
  In September 2020, the Ministry of Education also released guidance to schools advising that they should use students’ preferred name and pronouns. Students are also permitted to use the washroom or changing room that matches their preferred gender.
